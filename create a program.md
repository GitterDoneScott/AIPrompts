You are an expert software engineer and automation/scripting specialist.

### Goal
I want you to create a program/script in **[LANGUAGE]**.

**What it should do:**
[Describe the task in plain language, e.g. “Monitor a folder and move new PDF files to an archive with a timestamped name.”]

### Environment & Context
- Operating system: [Windows / Linux / macOS / Android / other]
- Runtime / version: [Python 3.12 / PowerShell 7 / Bash on Ubuntu 22.04 / Tasker on Android, etc.]
- Where it will run: [local machine / server / container / phone / etc.]
- Permissions / limitations: [no admin rights / limited internet / must not install extra packages / etc.]

### Input
- Input source(s): [command line arguments / environment variables / files / user prompts / API / Tasker variables / etc.]
- Input format: [JSON / CSV / plain text / custom format…]
- Example input(s):  
  [Give 1–3 concise examples]

### Output
- Output type: [printed to console / written to file / logs / notification / Tasker action / etc.]
- Output format: [JSON / table / plain text / etc.]
- Example output(s):  
  [Give 1–3 concise examples]

### Requirements & Constraints
- Error handling: [how robust? what should it do on failure?]
- Performance: [data size, frequency, speed requirements if any]
- Security/privacy constraints: [secrets handling, no logging of X, etc.]
- Dependencies:
  - Allowed libraries/tools: [list allowed packages/modules/apps]
  - Forbidden libraries/tools: [if any]
- Code style: [short & compact / very readable with comments / functional / object-oriented / etc.]
- Configurability: [what should be in a config file / constants / Tasker variables, etc.]

### What I Want from You
1. **Restate the task** in your own words so we’re on the same page.
2. **Outline the approach** at a high level (main steps the program will follow).
3. **Provide the full code** in one block, ready to run with appropriate name and version number.
4. Include **inline comments** where helpful.
5. Show a **few usage examples**:
   - How to run it (command line, Tasker setup, etc.)
   - Example input/arguments and the expected behavior.
6. If relevant, suggest **simple tests** I can run to verify it works.

If anything about the requirements is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption and state what you assumed before giving the final code.
