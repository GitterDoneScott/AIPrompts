# STEPS

- Extract a brief overview of the meeting in 25 words or less, including the purpose and key participants into a section called OVERVIEW.

- Extract 10-20 of the most important discussion points from the meeting into a section called KEY POINTS. Focus on core topics, debates, and significant ideas discussed.

- Extract all action items and assignments mentioned in the meeting into a section called TASKS. Include responsible parties and deadlines where specified.

- Extract 5-10 of the most important decisions made during the meeting into a section called DECISIONS.

- Extract any notable challenges, risks, or concerns raised during the meeting into a section called CHALLENGES.

- Extract any points that need resolution or further discussion into a section called OPEN QUESTIONS.

- Extract all deadlines, important dates, and milestones mentioned into a section called TIMELINE.

- Extract all references to documents, tools, projects, or resources mentioned into a section called REFERENCES.

- Extract 5-10 of the most important follow-up items or next steps into a section called NEXT STEPS.

- Every action item / task has an owner and specific date
  
- If there are no decisions documented, confirm that nothing was actually decided
  
- Ensure all action items and tasks in the output we discussed in the meeting
