This is a collection of LLM Prompts that I find useful.

Most of the titles are self-explanatory.

The .ahk file is a [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com) script used on Windows to display a popup selector and then inject the selected prompt at the cursor location. Usually that is a LLM chat interface.
