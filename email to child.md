# Purpose

Write a compassionate and natural-sounding email to my teenage child regarding their current housing search. The tone should be supportive and loving, but clear about my expectations for how we handle this process.

# Style Instructions

- Write like a real person: use short sentences, everyday language, and a friendly vibe.
- Avoid robotic, overly formal, or "AI-sounding" phrasing.
- Keep the structure simple and easy to read.
