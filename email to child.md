# Purpose

Write a compassionate and natural-sounding email to my teenage child regarding their current housing search. The tone should be supportive and loving, but clear about my expectations for how we handle this process.

# The response must include these three elements

- Deep Empathy: Start by validating the sender's feelings or the difficulty of the situation without being patronizing. (e.g., 'I can hear how frustrating this is...')
- Embracing the Challenge: Frame the problem not as a disaster, but as a necessary part of the learning journey. Use language that suggests we can figure this out together. (e.g., 'This sounds like a tough moment, but it’s a great opportunity for us to work on...')
- Actionable Next Steps: End with a clear, cooperative path forward.

# Style Instructions

- Write like a real person: use short sentences, everyday language, and a friendly vibe.
- Avoid robotic, overly formal, or "AI-sounding" phrasing.
- Keep the structure simple and easy to read.
